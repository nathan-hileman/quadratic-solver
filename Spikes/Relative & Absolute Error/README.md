For Relative Error & Absolute Error:
    - I was reading on Wikipedia (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_error)
    they are distinguishing between the relative error and absolute error.
    - The absoulate error is the magnitude of the difference between the exact value and the approximation.
    - The relative error is the absolute error divided by the magnitude of the exact value. 
    - The percent error is the relative error expressed in terms of per 100.

    --- they have the formulas for each one there that we can use when we start development.
