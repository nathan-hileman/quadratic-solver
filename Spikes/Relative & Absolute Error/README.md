# For Relative Error & Absolute Error:
<ul>
    <li> I was reading on Wikipedia (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_error)
    they are distinguishing between the relative error and absolute error. </li>
    <li> The absoulate error is the magnitude of the difference between the exact value and the approximation.</li>
    <li> The relative error is the absolute error divided by the magnitude of the exact value. </li>
    <li> The percent error is the relative error expressed in terms of per 100. </li>
</ul>
    <p><strong> they have the formulas for each one there that we can use when we start development.</strong></p>
