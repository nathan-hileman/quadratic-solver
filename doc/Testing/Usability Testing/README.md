#Usability Testing
We will provide one of the technicians at the given company to assist us with our usability testing and give us feedback on several areas where the technician ran into issues and its overall usability of our program. We will have use cases to cover normal uses like real solutions, non-real solutions, and more depending on the use cases provided which is all done without telling the technician how exactly the program works. After each use case, we will request a final feedback from the technician which will provide a more overall feedback on the general usability experience of our quadratic solver program.
