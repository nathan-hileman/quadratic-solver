Overview:
# IEEE Floating Point Ranges:
   
   <ol>
        <li> for the range like we talked in class we'll go with 8 if we want more or less we can change it later in development. </li>
        <li> we can set up our code to have a feature to be able to change the floating point range from ex: 8 to 7 (if need be). </li>
    </ol>

# IEEE Floating Point Precision:
   <ul>
      <li>i was reading online (link: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/311382/solving-a-quadratic-equation-with-precision-when-using-floating-point-variables) we can use the Citardauq Formula to have higher precision and the roots to a point where there is no loss of precision in one of the roots and also near high precision for the other.
    </li>
   </ul>
   
# Checking Inf, NaN, and normalized numbers:
This page has macros for checking all of it
